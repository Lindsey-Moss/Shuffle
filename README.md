### ***Description***
##### Mindfulness through tarot, on the go.

> “The Tarot is first and foremost a powerful instrument of self-knowledge.” 

— unattributed
> “The Major Arcana is the representation of a life’s journey towards enlightenment. It tells a story of ups and downs, of trials and exultations and lessons learned both painfully and gratefully.”

— Oriens Tarot
> “The best way I like to describe bullet journaling is that it’s a mindfulness practice that’s disguised as a productivity system. It’s more about why we’re doing what we’re doing.”

— Robert Carroll, creator of the bullet journaling method

**Shuffle** is a guided journaling app for anyone who finds the art of tarot intriguing; occult-inclined or not. Using the structure, symbolism, and inspirational designs of tarot cards and readings as a jumping off point, the app seeks to inspire users toward self-reflection, and to create a habit of introspective, growth-minded journaling.

Whether to face the day with a clear perspective using a "daily draw" first thing in the morning, or to button up the day's experiences with a reading to help clarify your thoughts at night, users are encouraged and empowered to use Shuffle wherever, whenever, however they like.

### ***Getting Started***
##### Loading the URL will take you to the home page, where you can choose to have a one-card "daily draw", or a multi-card spread for a more detailed reading. The app can be used for tarot readings without ever making an account, but by signing up, users can save their readings and create journal entries for future review.
##### A Trello board was used to track the progress of this application and can be viewed [here](https://trello.com/b/wXVjishL).
##### The project has been deployed on Heroku and can be viewed [here](X).
